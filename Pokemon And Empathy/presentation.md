# C

- Pros
  - Tight control over data layout

- Cons
  - "type" system

^ On the other side you have C, which gives you very tight control over how things are laid out, but you have to give up so much to get this.

---

![inline](why-not-both.jpg)

^ Rust loves to blow up traditional trade-offs like this. Concurrency without data races, memory safety without garbage collection, and so on. This is a big part of Rust's secret sauce. What make's it special. You could even call it...

# Rust's Fireflower

^ The combination of having control over memory layout combined with a proper type system can enable some *really* cool things. Let's look at an example. A `HashSet` is an unordered collection of unique elements. It works very much like a `HashMap` where you only look at the keys and not the values. Rust implements `HashSet` as a thin wrapper on top of `HashMap`.

---

```rust
pub struct HashSet<K> {
    map: HashMap<K, ()>
}

impl<K: Hash + Eq> HashSet<K> {
    pub fn insert(&mut self, value: K) {
        self.map.insert(value, ());
    }

    pub fn contains(&self, value: &K) -> bool {
        self.map.contains_key(value)
    }
}
```

^ Rust's implementation uses an empty tuple, also known as "unit" for the values here. The value itself doesn't matter for this implementation to be correct. For example, in Ruby they use a boolean. Here's that code:

---

```ruby
class Set
  def initialize
    @hash = {}
  end

  def insert(value)
    @hash[value] = true
  end

  def contains(value)
    @hash.key?(value)
  end
end
```

^ While both implementations are correct, there's a big difference in what's going on from a performance perspective. Specifically, Rust is able to take advantage of the fact that the value is zero sized, and eliminate a bunch of code. How big a difference? About 10-20% faster. That's free performance, and you can take advantage of those same kind of gains just by understanding some of the guarantees that Rust can provide.

^ As with all things in programming, there is a tradeoff here. In this case the cost that we're paying for the compiler to generate more efficient code is that it's increasing the size of our binary, and likely increasing compilation times as well. In some cases you can opt out of this if you'd rather not pay that cost.

---

```rust





fn say_hi(robot: &Robot) {
    println!("Hi, {}", robot.username());
}
```

^ By taking a reference to Robot, we're taking what's called a trait object. This is also sometimes referred to as "type erasure". When we take a trait object, the compiler no longer knows anything about the actual type being passed. This means that it can't do monomorphization, and the function won't be able to get optimized beyond this.

# These optimizations are what let us build zero cost abstractions

---

```rust
pub struct HashSet<K> {
    map: HashMap<K, ()>
}

impl<K: Hash + Eq> HashSet<K> {
    pub fn insert(&mut self, value: K) {
        self.map.insert(value, ());
    }

    pub fn contains(&self, value: &K) -> bool {
        self.map.contains_key(value)
    }
}
```

^ At the beginning of this talk I mentioned that using unit instead of bool was 10-20% faster, but I glossed over why that is the case. The reason is because the compiler knows that this value with 0 bytes can never be used. All of the generic code responsible for storing the values of a hash map is guaranteed to be eliminated, leaving us with the same code we'd have if we wrote a super-optimized specific hashset ourselves.

---

```rust
pub struct HashSet<K> {
    map: HashMap<K, ()>
}

impl<K: Hash + Eq> HashSet<K> {
    pub fn insert(&mut self, value: K) {
        self.map.insert(value, ());
    }

    pub fn contains(&self, value: &K) -> bool {
        self.map.contains_key(value)
    }
}
```

^ In theory the compiler could do the same optimization because it's just able to see that the values are never used. The use of a zero-sized type doesn't necessarily enable any optimizations that weren't possible before. However, they do *guarantee* that they will occur.
